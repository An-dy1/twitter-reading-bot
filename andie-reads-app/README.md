# My notes:

To run (from master):
`npm start`
A link is required but additional text is not.

Last error compiling angular code:
`Error: src/app/app.component.ts:2:18 - error TS2591: Cannot find name 'require'. Do you need to install type definitions for node? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/node` and then add 'node' to the types field in your tsconfig.`
