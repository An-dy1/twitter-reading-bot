# Todo: improvements

- do Python version of this script, for practice
- instead of using the Tweet service to handle oauth, use axios or a different client to separate out the authentication steps, for learning; then, use axios to send the request to the twitter endpoint
- make a delete-tweet function
- allow a second piece of input as well: 'do you have additional text to add? '
- make a little web app that can take this input? mobile app?

To run:

`npm start`
